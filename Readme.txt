My game has the working title of “Sigma Spear”. The design features an immobile player character positioned on the top of an elevated platform in the middle of the screen, which is also fixed. The platform could vary graphically, customizable by the player before starting the game, between tree trunk, tower, totem pole, marble column, and potentially other variants. The player character holds a spear and whenever the player is touching the screen, the player character aims the spear in the exact opposite direction of the player’s touch relative to the player character. When the player releases their touch, a spear object is thrown from the player character’s position at a velocity dependant on the distance of the player’s touch from the player character, and due to an effect simulating gravity the spear will fall somewhere on the ground at the bottom of the screen (unless the spear passes the screen border, which may not be possible given the maximum power the spear can be thrown at), while a few seconds are taken for the player character to “reequip” a new spear during which the player character cannot be utilized by the player.
	The other characters in the game are all hostile enemies. Enemies will spawn off the screen on either side, and make their way toward the player character across the ground at a fixed speed. Once an enemy reaches the platform the player character stands on, they will begin to traverse vertically up the platform until they reach the player character. If a spear object collides with an enemy, it is killed and will be wiped off the game instance. If an enemy collides with the player character the game ends and the amount of killed enemies is displayed and checked against the previous highscore. Enemies will continue to spawn endlessly at an increasing rate, however never up to a rate at which continued survival by the player is impossible. I am also considering having the speed of the enemies increase as time progresses.
	Based on the score the player earned in a session, i.e. the number of enemies they killed, they will receive a proportionate amount of in-game currency which they can use to purchase aesthetic variants for objects in the game, which they can swap in at will before starting a new session.
